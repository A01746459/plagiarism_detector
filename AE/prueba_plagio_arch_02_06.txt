Machine learning (ML) is a form of artificial intelligence which is placed to transform the twenty-first century. Rapid, recent progress in its underlying architecture and algorithms and growth in the size of datasets have led to. The results of this study find that there was empathy in human-chatbot interaction, regardless of whether participants perceive anthropomorphic chatbots as humans or machines. However, the level of empathy was generally low as participants become frustrated when they were dissatisfied with the response of chatbots and exit the chatbots without expressing their frustration. They usually forgot their frustration and came again with other questions another time. The study also showed that participants may expect more help and politeness if chatbots are more likely to be female.
